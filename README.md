# 🎓 Synaptor

AI that adapts to how you learn.

Synaptor is an AI-powered adaptive learning system that personalizes teaching by understanding learning behavior, not just right or wrong answers.
Instead of following a fixed curriculum, Synaptor dynamically adjusts difficulty, teaching style, and pacing—just like a human tutor.

## ✨ Why Synaptor?

Most digital learning platforms focus on what students learn.
Synaptor focuses on how students learn.

By analyzing behavioral signals such as response time, attempts, and engagement, Synaptor builds a learning profile for each student and adapts instruction in real time.
